This is a inventory management system build using c#, .Net and Microsoft SQL server. It is tailored to the needs of a general Golf product distributor. 
The user can manage product supply as well as log and maintain orders through the user interface created in windows forms. This project helped me 
a lot about performing SQL queries and building applications with Microsoft .Net.
